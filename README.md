# Hopf Bifurcations in FitzHugh-Nagumo Neuronal Model
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that generates three GIFs depicting the behavior of the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal model with subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations. The generated GIFs are named animation1.gif, animation2.gif, and animation3.gif, and can be found in the same repository.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
SciPy

##Usage

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages using pip:

```{bash}
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebook file `Saddle Node.ipynb`.
Run the notebook cells to generate the GIFs.
Generated GIFs
The following GIFs are generated by the notebook:

animation1.gif
![animation1.gif](animation1.gif)

animation2.gif
![animation2.gif](animation1.gif)

animation3.gif
![animation3.gif](animation1.gif)

Acknowledgements
The notebook is based on the work of FitzHugh (1961) and Nagumo (1962), who developed the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. The GIFs are generated using the animation package of Matplotlib.
